# Changelog

All notable changes to the `web-starter` template are documented here. Downstream sites
should track which version of the starter they're on (commit SHA or version tag) so
upgrades are deliberate.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Four new page-builder blocks: `featureGrid`, `logoCloud`, `testimonial`, `faq`
- `SanityImage` component wrapping `next/image` with asset metadata (dimensions + LQIP blur)
- `npm run seed` script that writes a `siteSettings` singleton and a `home` page so a fresh dataset renders something at `/` immediately
- Full brand color scale (50–950) plus accent / semantic surface + text tokens
- `not-found.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `loading.tsx` under `(site)/` plus a root `global-error.tsx`

### Changed
- `<img>` replaced with `SanityImage` in Hero, blog index, blog post header, and PortableText image renderer
- GROQ image fragments now request `asset->metadata { dimensions, lqip }` so next/image gets correct width/height + blur placeholder
- `Sections.tsx` warns in dev when a block `_type` has no registered renderer
- `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin enabled (prose styles in blog posts now render)
- Stega disabled in the published Sanity client; production HTML no longer contains Visual Editing source markers
- Custom fonts loaded via `next/font` (Inter / Playfair Display / JetBrains Mono) and bound to the `--font-*` CSS variables Tailwind expects

## [0.1.0] - Initial release
